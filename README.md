# A new react state management framework

#### Language: English | [Chinese](./README_zh_CN.md)

## Project description

What is the essence of UI state?
> One main mutation causes **N** extra mutations. The more complex the UI, the larger the **N**.

*(If you have ever developed more complex UI, you will resonate with it. If not, donâ€™t worry, let's discuss it together in the [Project context](./site/background.md).)*

This is the essence of UI, also the biggest trouble of UI development.

**The framework allows developers to focus only on the main mutation, because extra mutations are handled automatically**

## About REST

The project name is "graphql-state". Don't worry, it's **"GraphQL style, but not GraphQL only"**, it can map REST service to GraphQL service.
