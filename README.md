# A new react state management framework(English | [中文](./README_zh_CN.md))

> Note:
>
> **GraphQL style, but not GraphQL only**
>
> For REST services, this framework can map them to GraphQL services on the client side, it can access REST services with GraphQL's powerful semantics!

This framework provides three major functions
1. Simple state management: similar to [recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil)
2. Graph state management: The core value of this framework, providing services far smarter than [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay) is the fundamental purpose of the project. Please view [Project Background](./site/background.md) to know more
3. HTTP optimization: reduce the number of HTTP requests through merge requests and reuse
